# Automation Status

## Fully Automated (GitHub Actions)

| Component | Trigger | Workflow | Status |
|-----------|---------|----------|--------|
| Infrastructure Deployment | Push to main/manual | `.github/workflows/terraform.yml` | Automated |
| Docker Build & Push to ECR | Push to main/develop | `.github/workflows/ecr-push.yml` | Automated |
| Application Testing | Push/PR to main | `.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml` | Automated |
| Test Coverage (97%) | On every test run | `make all` | Automated |
| Helm Deployment to EKS | Push to main (after build) | `.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml` | Automated |
| Security Scanning (Trivy) | On every build | Both workflows | Automated |
| Smoke Tests | After deployment | `.github/workflows/build-deploy.yml` | Automated |

## Semi-Automated (One-time Setup)

| Component | Script/Tool | Frequency | Status |
|-----------|------------|-----------|--------|
| GitHub Secrets Setup | `scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh` | Once per repo | Script provided |
| Terraform Backend Init | `terraform/init-backend.sh` | Once per AWS account | Script provided |
| AWS CLI Configuration | `aws configure` | Once per developer | Manual |

## Manual Steps (Required)

| Step | Why Manual | Automation Possibility |
|------|------------|------------------------|
| AWS Account Creation | Security/billing | Cannot automate |
| GitHub Repo Creation | One-time setup | Could use GitHub API |
| Initial AWS Credentials | Security requirement | Must be manual |
| Domain/DNS Setup | External provider specific | Depends on provider |

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Infrastructure Workflow (`terraform.yml`)
- Triggers: Push to main, manual dispatch
- Actions:
  - Validates Terraform syntax
  - Plans infrastructure changes
  - Applies changes (main branch only)
  - Manages state in S3
  - Handles destroy operations

### ECR Push Workflow (`ecr-push.yml`)
- Triggers: Push to main/develop, manual dispatch
- Actions:
  - Builds Docker image with Buildx
  - Caches Docker layers
  - Pushes to ECR with multiple tags
  - Scans for vulnerabilities
  - Generates deployment instructions

### Build & Deploy Workflow (`build-deploy.yml`)
- Triggers: Push/PR to main
- Actions:
  - Runs Python tests with 97% coverage requirement
  - Builds and pushes Docker images
  - Deploys to EKS using Helm
  - Verifies deployment health
  - Runs smoke tests

## Quality Gates

- Test coverage: 97% (exceeds 90% requirement)
- All tests must pass before deployment
- Security scanning on every build
- Type checking and linting enforced
- `make all` validation required

## Manual Intervention Triggers

These scenarios require manual intervention:

1. First-time setup - Running init scripts
2. Secret rotation - Updating AWS credentials in GitHub
3. Breaking changes - Reviewing Terraform destroy operations
4. Production approvals - Can be added as GitHub environment protection

## Future Automation Opportunities

1. GitOps with ArgoCD - Further automate K8s deployments
2. Automated PR environments - Spin up preview environments
3. Cost optimization - Automated resource scaling based on metrics
4. Backup automation - Scheduled database/state backups
5. Compliance scanning - Automated security/compliance checks
