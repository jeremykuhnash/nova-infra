# Wiki Migration Notice

## BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md → GitHub Wiki

**Date**: 2025-09-16

### Action Required

The `BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md` file should be migrated to the GitHub repository wiki for better organization and searchability.

### Steps to Complete Migration

1. **Create GitHub Wiki**:

   ```bash
   # Enable wiki in repository settings
   # Go to Settings → Features → Wikis → Enable
   ```

2. **Migrate Content**:

   - Copy content from `BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md` to wiki pages
   - Organize by year/milestone for better navigation
   - Create index page with links to all completion logs

3. **Suggested Wiki Structure**:

   ```
   Home
   ├── Project History
   │   ├── 2025 Completed Work
   │   ├── Milestones Achieved
   │   └── Lessons Learned
   ├── Architecture Decisions
   └── Development Process
   ```

4. **Update References**:
   - Update `README.md` to link to wiki instead of file
   - Add wiki link to project documentation
   - Remove `BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md` from repository

### Benefits of Migration

- **Better searchability** within GitHub ecosystem
- **Improved navigation** with wiki sidebar
- **Collaborative editing** with version control
- **Reduced repository clutter** for active development files

### Current File Location

The current `BACKLOG_COMPLETED.md` file has been preserved and should be migrated manually to maintain the project's historical record.
